    <h1>Carpooling</h1>
    <p>
      In response to growing urban congestion, environmental concerns, and
      rising transportation costs, this project proposes a Car Pooling System
      designed to optimize shared travel among commuters. The system facilitates
      ride-sharing by connecting drivers with available seats to passengers
      traveling similar routes, thereby reducing the number of vehicles on the
      road. The platform leverages location-based services, user authentication,
      and real-time scheduling to ensure secure and efficient matching. Key
      features include route optimization, cost splitting, user ratings, and
      dynamic ride suggestions. By promoting collaborative commuting, the system
      aims to lower carbon emissions, reduce traffic, and make daily travel more
      affordable and socially engaging. This project demonstrates the potential
      of technology-driven solutions to address urban mobility challenges,
      offering a scalable model for sustainable transportation. --- Would you
